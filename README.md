## Chess Board
A class which has the following properties:

An 8 by 8 grid made of black or white tile spaces to represent the board

Red Coordinates to represent the position of the red queen

Blue coordinates to represent the position of the blue queen

This class also has the following methods:

add_red adds the red queen to grid tile located at the input coordinates

add_blue which does the same for the blue queen

render which displays the current position of the queens and the board they sit on

is_under_attack which tells you if the queens are attacking one another
